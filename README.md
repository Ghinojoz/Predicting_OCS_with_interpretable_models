# Predicting OCS with interpretable models

## Overview
This project seeks to predicy atmospheric Carbonyl Sulfide using interpretable machine learning models. The work is ongoing (as of 6/3/2022)

 ## Data
 Unfortunately the data is too large to host on Github. However, it can be obtained at the following drive link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MaQUnTjBzbX4Gu3s0zsYRx38mYWGp9QH?usp=sharing

The entire folder must be downloaded and placed in the root project directory, i.e. './Data'

## Code
This project contains several .ipynb scripts intended to be run in google colab. A description of what each does can be found below. The code is meant to be run in sequence, that is some scripts described later on in this document depend on earlier scripts being successfully run.
